## Important Notes

### Link Formats
Any valid Google Drive link works, including:

**For Files:**
```
https://drive.google.com/file/d/YOUR_FILE_ID/view?usp=sharing
https://drive.google.com/file/d/YOUR_FILE_ID/view
https://drive.google.com/file/d/YOUR_FILE_ID/edit
```

**For Folders:**
```
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/YOUR_FOLDER_ID?usp=sharing
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/YOUR_FOLDER_ID
```

### File Requirements
- Individual files should be PDF format
- Folders can contain multiple PDFs and other document types
- Files and folders should be properly named and organized
- Any Google Drive link works (public or private)

### Benefits of New System
- Faster downloads (direct from Google Drive)
- No file size limits
- Better reliability
- Support for multiple files through folders
- Reduced server storage costs
- Files remain accessible even if our platform is down

### When to Use Folders vs Files
- **Use individual files** for single documents (notes, single PYQ, etc.)
- **Use folders** for related materials (complete chapter materials, multiple PYQs, etc.)

## Troubleshooting

### Invalid Link Error
If you get an "invalid link" error, make sure:
- The link starts with `https://drive.google.com/`
- **For files**: The link contains `/file/d/FILE_ID`
- **For folders**: The link contains `/drive/folders/FOLDER_ID`
- You copied the entire link without any extra characters

### File/Folder Not Accessible
If users can't access your file or folder:
- Make sure the file/folder hasn't been deleted from your Google Drive
- Verify the link is still working by testing it in an incognito browser window
- For private files, users will need to request access from you
- For folders, ensure files within the folder are accessible to users

## Migration from Old System
Existing files uploaded through the old system will continue to work. However, we recommend gradually migrating important files to Google Drive for better performance and reliability.
