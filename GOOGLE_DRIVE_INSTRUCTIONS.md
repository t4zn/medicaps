# Google Drive File Sharing Instructions

## Overview
The platform has been updated to use Google Drive links instead of direct file uploads. This provides better reliability and faster access to files.

## How to Upload Files

### Step 1: Upload to Google Drive
1. Go to [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com)
2. Upload your PDF file to Google Drive
3. Make sure the file is properly named (e.g., "Chapter 1 Notes.pdf")

### Step 2: Get Sharing Link
1. Right-click on your uploaded file
2. Select "Share" from the context menu
3. Click "Change to anyone with the link"
4. Make sure it's set to "Viewer" permissions
5. Copy the sharing link

### Step 3: Add to Platform
1. Go to the upload page on our platform
2. Enter the file name exactly as it appears in Google Drive
3. Paste the Google Drive sharing link
4. Complete the other required fields (program, year, subject, category)
5. Click "Add File Link"

## Important Notes

### Link Format
The Google Drive link must be in this format:
```
https://drive.google.com/file/d/YOUR_FILE_ID/view?usp=sharing
```

### File Requirements
- Files must be PDF format
- Files should be properly named and organized
- Make sure sharing permissions are set to "Anyone with the link can view"

### Benefits of New System
- Faster downloads (direct from Google Drive)
- No file size limits
- Better reliability
- Reduced server storage costs
- Files remain accessible even if our platform is down

## Troubleshooting

### Invalid Link Error
If you get an "invalid link" error, make sure:
- The link ends with `/view?usp=sharing`
- The file is set to "Anyone with the link can view"
- You copied the entire link without any extra characters

### File Not Accessible
If users can't access your file:
- Check that the sharing permissions are correct
- Make sure the file hasn't been deleted from your Google Drive
- Verify the link is still working by testing it in an incognito browser window

## Migration from Old System
Existing files uploaded through the old system will continue to work. However, we recommend gradually migrating important files to Google Drive for better performance and reliability.
