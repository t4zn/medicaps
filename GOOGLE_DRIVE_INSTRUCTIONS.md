### File Requirements
- Individual files should be PDF format
- Folders can contain multiple PDFs and other document types
- Google Docs can be Documents, Sheets, or Slides
- Files, folders, and documents should be properly named and organized
- Any Google Drive or Google Docs link works (public or private)

### Benefits of New System
- Faster downloads (direct from Google services)
- No file size limits
- Better reliability
- Support for multiple files through folders
- Support for collaborative Google Docs
- Real-time document updates
- Reduced server storage costs
- Files remain accessible even if our platform is down

### When to Use Different Options
- **Use individual files** for single PDF documents (notes, single PYQ, etc.)
- **Use folders** for related materials (complete chapter materials, multiple PYQs, etc.)
- **Use Google Docs** for collaborative notes, study guides, or documents that need regular updates
- **Use Google Sheets** for data tables, formula references, or calculation sheets
- **Use Google Slides** for presentation materials or visual study guides

## Troubleshooting

### Invalid Link Error
If you get an "invalid link" error, make sure:
- **For Drive files**: The link starts with `https://drive.google.com/file/d/FILE_ID`
- **For Drive folders**: The link starts with `https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/FOLDER_ID`
- **For Google Docs**: The link starts with `https://docs.google.com/document/d/DOC_ID`
- **For Google Sheets**: The link starts with `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/SHEET_ID`
- **For Google Slides**: The link starts with `https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/SLIDE_ID`
- You copied the entire link without any extra characters

### File/Folder/Document Not Accessible
If users can't access your content:
- Make sure the file/folder/document hasn't been deleted from your Google account
- Verify the link is still working by testing it in an incognito browser window
- For private content, users will need to request access from you
- For folders, ensure files within the folder are accessible to users
- For Google Docs, make sure sharing permissions are set to "Anyone with the link"

## Migration from Old System
Existing files uploaded through the old system will continue to work. However, we recommend gradually migrating important files to Google Drive for better performance and reliability.
